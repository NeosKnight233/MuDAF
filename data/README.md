# Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks

## Training Data

Questions are from the [HotpotQA](http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/datasets/hotpot/hotpot_train_v1.1.json) official website.

We expanded their negative passages with data collected by [LongRAG](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/LongRAG/viewer/hotpot_qa_corpus).


## Evaluation Benchmarks

For LongBench, we included HotpotQA, 2WikiMQA, MuSiQue and Qasper.

For ZeroSCROLLS, we included MuSiQue and Qasper.
